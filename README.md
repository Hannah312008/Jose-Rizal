# Jose-Rizal
Some qualities that would describe Jose Rizal are being open-minded, intelligent, and hardworking. Jose really wanted to have freedom in the Philippines from Spain, so that the Filipinos did not have to be controlled by another country. He did not care about himself. He cared more about helping his country.
